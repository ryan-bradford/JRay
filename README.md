A 3D Engine Made in Java!

This 3D engine is the first project that makes full use of the TaskManager project. It is built using simple trigonometric 
functions. It displays simple 2D shaped in a 3D environment very efficiently. It takes the x-angle and y-angle between the 
camera's center of view and converts that measurement to a pixel offset using the sin, cos, or tan of the angle and the screen
dimensions. 

The limitations of the engine include lighting and texturing. While both are possible, they may turnout to be very inefficient or 
glitchy.
